# Liburing header-only

This is an implementation of liburing that's header only.

This is a work in progress right now.

### Goals of this fork

- **Header Only**
- **No Undefined Behaviours**
- **Standard compliant (No compiler-specific features)**
- **-pedantic friendly**
- **C and C++ compatiblity** without any `extern "C"` or `extern "C++"`es
